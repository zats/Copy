A simple app for OS X, adding Copy to Share menu across the system

[Download](https://github.com/zats/Copy/releases/tag/1.1) latest build.

**Note**: one of the goals was to replicate iOS behaviour as close as possible, thus I didn't want to show the mandatory UI, for that I have to crash the extension right after content was copied into the pasteboard.
